Standard process for publishing NSF Arctic Data Center update 

##About
The Arctic Data Center is the primary data and software repository for the Arctic section of NSF Polar Programs.
Strong partnerships for preservation

The NSF Arctic Data Center will help the research community reproducibly preserve and discover all products of NSF-funded science in the Arctic, including data, metadata, software, documents, and provenance that link these in a coherent knowledge model. Key to the initiative is the partnership between NCEAS at UC Santa Barbara, DataONE, and NOAA’s NCEI, each of which bring critical capabilities to the Center. Infrastructure from the successful NSF-sponsored DataONE federation of data repositories will enable data replication to NCEI, providing both offsite and institutional diversity that is critical to long term preservation.

###Data management tools
Researcher-facing submission tools will provide convenient pathways to document and archive diverse data formats as part of scientists’ normal workflows (e.g., both through the web and via analytical tools such as Matlab, R, and IDL). This infrastructure will be supported with an outstanding set of community services, including data discovery tools, metadata assessment and editing, data cleansing and integration, data management consulting, and user help-desk services. While the Arctic Data Center won’t launch with all of these services in place, they will be added incrementally through a set of iterative improvements based on strong feedback from the Arctic research community.

For scientists, the Arctic Data Center is an efficient way to share, discover, access, and interpret complex data about the Arctic. Due to rich contextual information provided with data, scientists are able to integrate and analyze data with less effort. The data originate from a highly-distributed set of field stations, laboratories, research sites, and individual researchers. The foundation of the Arctic Data Center is the rich, detailed metadata provided by researchers that collect data, which promotes both automated and manual integration of data into new projects.

###Open-source software
As part of the Arctic Data Center effort, data management software is developed in a free and open source manner, so other groups can build upon the tools. The Arctic Data Center is powered by the Metacat data management system, and is optimized for handling data sets described using the Ecological Metadata Language, but can store any XML-based metadata document. Metacat and EML are also used by many repositories, including the KNB Data Repository and the DataONE search system.
